This is an expository paper on the asymptotic properties of the classical logistic regression model. We rigorously prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of the MLE and present some R simulations. We uploaded the relevant dataset and R code so that the reader can run the simulations himself. The language of the documentation is Romanian.
